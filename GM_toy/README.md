# GM_toy

Function that creates GMM model and random sample form that model and finally fit GMM to generated points. 

## Usage

To test GMM fitting on N=100 points type in MATLAB Command Window:

```
>> GM_toy(100) 
```

The bigger N the better chance to obtain good fit.


## What I have learnt?

  * use `gmdistribution` and `gmdistribution.fit`
