# PairingPoints
Scripts that show three problems related to finding closest neighbour point. 


  * Test 1: finds one closest point to test point p. 
  * Test 2: Tries to match two sets of points with repeats allowed
  * Test 3: Tries to match two sets of points with repeats NOT allowed


## What I have learnt?

  * using `bsxfun` 
  * connecting points with lines
  * using `scatter` and `scatter3`
  * plot legends and multiline titles
