# Fieldtrip_covariance_filtering

Script that show visual differences between covariance matrices of multi-channel signals caused by different filtering types.

## What I have learnt?

  * using [Fieldtrip toolbox](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) for band-pass filtering of the multi-channel data 
  * using cell arrays to store structures
