# EM_Algorithm

Scripts showing animation of fitting Gaussian Mixture Model to randomly generated data, 1D or 2D, respectively.

**NOTE !**
Depending on the randomness of the data sometimes algorithm will not converge well (stopping criterion: reaching maximum number of iterations).

## What I have learnt?

  * how Expectation-Maximization algorithm works
  * how to plot Gaussians
  * how to animate plots 
  * how to annotate plots
