# bootstrap_sampling

Two examples how to literally code bootstrap in MATLAB using two examples from book of [\[1\]](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Analysis-Resampling-Concepts-Applications/dp/0534221106). 

Example 1 (`bootstrap_example1.m`) shows calculation of a 100-boostrap estimate of a Pearson's correlation coefficient between two variables. It provides visualization for selected cases and sampling distribution.

Example 2 (`bootstrap_example2.m`) shows that bootstrap is not always accurate method for estimating population parameter and some discrepations may arise when one uses real-world sample. It provides visualization for selected cases and sampling distribution.

## What I have learnt?
* how bootstrap works
* how to add annotations to graphs
* how to use third-party code (`hline.m` and `vline.m` scripts made by [Brandon Kuczeński](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/1039-hline-and-vline)
