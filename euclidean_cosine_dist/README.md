# euclidean_cosine_dist 

Generate couple of vectors and calculate distance between each pair of them. Two types of distance are used: 
  * euclidean
  * cosine

## What I have learnt?
 
  * cosine distance "ignores" magnitude differences - it only compares angle between vectors 
  * `imagesc`: control Y-axis direction
